Check if your open source project's name is already taken. Silly idea, good for
a limited scope to get used to c (well...). Mimicked github.com/LogIN-/ospnc
but this is probably a very old idea.

Not including black duck (formerly ohloh) because it iss insanely slow, or
github because you cannot search for exact matches of repository names.
